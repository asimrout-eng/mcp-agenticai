# 🎭 Agentic AI Loop Demo Guide

## 🎯 **How to Demonstrate the Agentic Loop to Your Audience**

This guide provides a step-by-step presentation script for showcasing the **autonomous reasoning capabilities** of your Agentic AI Business Intelligence demo.

## 🔄 **The Agentic Loop Explained**

### **What Is an Agentic Loop?**
An **agentic loop** is the autonomous reasoning cycle that AI agents use to solve complex problems:

```
🔍 OBSERVE → 📋 PLAN → ⚡ ACT → 💡 LEARN → 🎯 REFLECT → 🔄 ADAPT
```

Unlike traditional AI that just responds to prompts, **agentic AI** continuously cycles through this loop to improve its understanding and decision-making.
