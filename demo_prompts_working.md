*Visualization*: Bar chart comparing campaign types

```sql
SELECT 
    c.campaign_type,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ae.event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 END) as total_conversions,
    SUM(ae.revenue_usd) as total_revenue
FROM campaigns c
JOIN ad_events ae ON c.campaign_id = ae.campaign_id
WHERE c.advertiser = 'AutoCorp'
GROUP BY c.campaign_type
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### **2. Publisher Performance Analysis**
**"Which publishers are performing best for AutoCorp in terms of conversion rate and revenue?"**

*Perfect for*: Complex joins across all 3 tables

```sql
SELECT 
    p.publisher_name,
    p.region,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ae.event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 END) as conversions,
    COUNT(ae.event_id) as total_events,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN ae.event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / NULLIF(COUNT(ae.event_id), 0), 2) as conversion_rate,
    SUM(ae.revenue_usd) as total_revenue
FROM campaigns c
JOIN ad_events ae ON c.campaign_id = ae.campaign_id
JOIN publishers p ON ae.publisher_id = p.publisher_id
WHERE c.advertiser = 'AutoCorp'
GROUP BY p.publisher_name, p.region

ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC, total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **3. Hourly Performance Trends (CTE Example)**
**"Show me AutoCorp's hourly conversion patterns with revenue trends"**

*Perfect for*: CTEs, window functions, time analysis
*Expected Result*: Hourly breakdown with trends
*Visualization*: Time-series line chart

```sql
WITH hourly_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        ae.event_hour,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ae.event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 END) as conversions,
        SUM(ae.revenue_usd) as revenue,
        COUNT(ae.event_id) as total_events
    FROM campaigns c
    JOIN ad_events ae ON c.campaign_id = ae.campaign_id
    WHERE c.advertiser = 'AutoCorp'
    GROUP BY ae.event_hour
)
SELECT 
    event_hour,
    conversions,
    revenue,
    ROUND(conversions * 100.0 / NULLIF(total_events, 0), 2) as conversion_rate,
    LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY event_hour) as prev_hour_revenue
FROM hourly_stats
ORDER BY event_hour;
```

### **4. Cost Efficiency Analysis**
**"What's the cost per conversion and ROI for each of AutoCorp's campaign types?"**

*Perfect for*: Advanced calculations, business metrics
*Expected Result*: ROI and efficiency metrics by campaign type
*Visualization*: Efficiency comparison chart

```sql
SELECT 
    c.campaign_type,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ae.event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 END) as total_conversions,
    SUM(ae.cost_usd) as total_cost,
    SUM(ae.revenue_usd) as total_revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(ae.cost_usd) / NULLIF(COUNT(CASE WHEN ae.event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 END), 0), 2) as cost_per_conversion,
    ROUND((SUM(ae.revenue_usd) - SUM(ae.cost_usd)) / NULLIF(SUM(ae.cost_usd), 0) * 100, 2) as roi_percentage
FROM campaigns c
JOIN ad_events ae ON c.campaign_id = ae.campaign_id
WHERE c.advertiser = 'AutoCorp'
GROUP BY c.campaign_type
HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN ae.event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 END) > 0
ORDER BY roi_percentage DESC;
```

---

### **5. Regional Campaign Performance**
**"Break down AutoCorp's campaign performance by publisher region and campaign type"**

*Perfect for*: Multi-dimensional analysis, complex grouping
*Expected Result*: Matrix of region x campaign type performance
*Visualization*: Heatmap-style comparison

```sql
SELECT 
    p.region,
    c.campaign_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.campaign_id) as active_campaigns,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN ae.event_type = 'conversion' THEN 1 END) as conversions,
    SUM(ae.revenue_usd) as revenue,
    AVG(ae.revenue_usd) as avg_revenue_per_event
FROM campaigns c
JOIN ad_events ae ON c.campaign_id = ae.campaign_id
JOIN publishers p ON ae.publisher_id = p.publisher_id
WHERE c.advertiser = 'AutoCorp'
GROUP BY p.region, c.campaign_type
ORDER BY p.region, revenue DESC;
```
